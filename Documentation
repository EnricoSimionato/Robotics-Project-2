Folder "config": 
	- amcl.launch.xml contains the paramters which are needed to perform localization with amcl algorithm;
	-gmapping.launch.xml contains the parameters which are needed to perform gmapping SLAM algorithm.
Folder "launch":
	- amcl.launch starts all the nodes related to amcl localization (map server, amcl, scan_merger, node to broadcast odometry as a tf)
	- gmapping.launch starts all the nodes related to gmapping (map server, amcl, scan_merger, node to broadcast odometry as a tf)
